# Hi, I’m Kaarel (KJ)

SCADA Team Lead working on renewable energy operations. Software Engineering student at TalTech.

I work on systems where uptime and data quality matter, and I build software that helps stakeholders understand operational data and make decisions.

- Build SCADA and web views/dashboards that turn data into usable information
