# 👋 Hi, I’m Kaarel (aka KJ)

🎓 **Software Engineering student @ TalTech (Tallinn University of Technology)**  
💻 Aspiring **full-stack developer** with a strong focus on clean architecture, databases, and practical problem-solving.

## 🚀 About Me

I enjoy turning real-world problems into structured, working software.  
Most of my projects come from **university coursework**, where I focus on:

- solid **architecture decisions**
- clear **domain modeling**
- readable, maintainable code
- learning *why* things work — not just *how*

I’m currently building experience across **backend, web, and data-centric applications**, often under exam-style constraints where prioritization matters.

## 🧠 Tech Interests & Skills

**Languages & Platforms**
- C# (.NET, Razor Pages)
- Java (OOP, Streams, persistence)
- Python
- SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL)

**Key Topics**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Layered architecture (DAL / BLL / UI)
- CRUD applications & validation
- Databases, normalization, ERDs
- Entity Framework Core
- REST basics & API integration
- Git & version control

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- Advanced **C# / .NET** patterns  
- **Java** for backend and data processing  
- Better **full-stack workflows** (data → logic → UI)
- Writing clearer technical documentation (README, specs, reports)

---

## 🤝 Collaboration

I’m open to:
- small but **well-defined projects**
- learning-oriented collaborations
- projects where **code quality and structure matter**

If it’s interesting and helps me grow — I’m in.
