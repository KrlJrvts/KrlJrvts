# 👋 Hi, I’m Kaarel (aka KJ)

⚡ **SCADA Team Lead by day**  
🎓 **Software Engineering student @ TalTech by night**

I work with real industrial systems where **availability, data integrity, and delivery matter** — and I study software engineering to sharpen architecture, backend design, and long-term maintainability.

---

## 🧭 Professional Focus

I combine **hands-on engineering** with **leadership and delivery ownership**.

By day, I operate in environments where:
- systems are live
- data must be trustworthy
- stakeholders need clear answers
- deadlines are real

By night, I focus on building **clean, structured software**, mostly through university projects and focused experiments.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

**Backend & APIs**
- **Java REST APIs** (JAX-RS / Spring-style architecture)
- C# / .NET (Razor Pages, layered apps)
- Python (automation, tooling)

**Data & Persistence**
- SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Database modeling, normalization, ERDs
- ORM usage (EF Core, JPA concepts)

**Engineering Practices**
- Layered architecture (DAL / BLL / API / UI)
- Validation & error handling
- CRUD systems built for clarity
- MVP-first delivery under time constraints
- Git-based workflows

---

## 🧠 Strengths Beyond Code

I bring **team-lead / project-manager thinking** into engineering work:

- 📋 **Project planning & prioritization**
- 🚀 **Delivery ownership** (from idea → working solution)
- 🧩 **Analytical problem solving**
- 🗣️ **User & stakeholder interviews**
- 🧠 Translating business or operational needs into technical solutions
- 📖 Clear technical documentation

This mindset strongly influences how I structure APIs, databases, and application layers.

---

## 🌱 Currently Developing

- Advanced **Java backend & REST API design**
- Cleaner **API contracts and data models**
- Bridging **industrial systems** with modern software architecture
- Improving communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders

---

## 🤝 Collaboration

Interested in:
- backend or API-driven projects
- systems with real constraints and users
- teams that value **thinking, planning, and delivery** — not just writing code

If you need someone who can both **build** and **lead**, let’s talk.

## 🎸 Outside Work

- 🎵 Guitar
- 🎮 PC gaming
- 🌊 Kitesurfing & wingfoiling
